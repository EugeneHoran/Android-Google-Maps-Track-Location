# Android-Google-Maps-Track-Location

**Google Maps V2 Implementation** 

Had a lot of fun working with Google maps. This is a fairly complicated project but once you get the hang of how maps function it gets smooth fairly quick.

Features:
- Track your location and history.
- Save your run and view it later.
- Animate camera based on bearing and location change.
- History items sets camera bounds fit polylines and markers.
- Change Map Type.
- Calculates distance based on start location and current location.
- SQLite database
- [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCMQrW9lLKs), working on an emulator so it may look akward
